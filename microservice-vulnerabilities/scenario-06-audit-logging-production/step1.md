# Configure and use audit logging — Production tutorial

On EKS, control-plane audit logs can be sent to CloudWatch. Choose categories and retention deliberately; the query and response process remains yours.

A production implementation normally includes:

- an approved baseline and owner;
- infrastructure-as-code or image automation;
- monitoring and evidence retention;
- a change window, rollback, and exception expiry;
- a test after Kubernetes, node, image, or cloud changes.

On AWS, the same security intent applies. AWS may operate one layer, such as the EKS control plane, while your team owns identities, workload policy, node configuration, and evidence. Map that shared-responsibility boundary explicitly.
