# Exercise caution in using service accounts — Learn

A service account is a workload identity, not a human account. Automatic token mounting is like handing every process a master key when most applications need none.

Inspect token mounting, projected tokens, image pull secrets, and service-account subjects in RBAC bindings. Use kubectl auth can-i with a service-account identity.

Try these commands:

~~~bash
kubectl version
kubectl get nodes -o wide
kubectl get pods -A
~~~

Use them to observe the environment. You do not need to prove that you ran them; the point is to make the cluster feel familiar.


## Deep-dive workflow

This section expands the exam objective into a security investigation:

1. **Define the asset and boundary.** Write down what is being protected, who can reach it, and whether the control is enforced by the API server, admission, a node, the runtime, the network plugin, or the workload.
2. **Capture a baseline.** Record the current object, labels, identities, processes, ports, events, logs, and relevant configuration before making a change.
3. **Trace the control path.** Follow the request or workload through every intermediary. Do not stop at an object existing; verify that the active component consumes it.
4. **Make one narrow change.** Preserve unrelated workloads, names, namespaces, availability, and existing policy intent.
5. **Test both sides.** Prove the desired behavior and test a nearby denied, invalid, or unexpected case where applicable.
6. **Preserve evidence.** Save the command output, manifest, timestamp, and final status so another operator can reproduce the conclusion.

**Security focus:** Separate authentication, identity, authorization, and admission. Test permissions with kubectl auth can-i and keep grants namespace-scoped.

Suggested investigation commands:

~~~bash
kubectl get --raw='/readyz?verbose'
kubectl get nodes -o wide
kubectl get events -A --sort-by=.lastTimestamp
kubectl get pods -A -o wide
kubectl get RESOURCE NAME -n NAMESPACE -o yaml
kubectl describe RESOURCE NAME -n NAMESPACE
~~~

Replace the placeholders only after identifying the real resource. The describe command explains symptoms; rendered YAML and status prove the stored state.
