# Perform static analysis of Kubernetes manifests — Inferno

Static analysis catches insecure intent before a manifest reaches the API server: privileged containers, host paths, missing probes, mutable images, and excessive capabilities.

Deep-dive mission:

1. Find the authoritative configuration source.
2. Identify the unsafe setting and preserve a backup.
3. Remediate only the affected boundary.
4. Test both the requested access and a denied access.
5. Confirm the API server, node, and workloads remain healthy.

~~~bash
sudo find /etc/kubernetes /var/lib/kubelet -maxdepth 3 -type f 2>/dev/null | sort
kubectl get --raw='/readyz?verbose'
kubectl get events -A --sort-by=.lastTimestamp
~~~

Fix the requested manifest findings, run the scanner again, and record justified exceptions in code review.


## Deep-dive workflow

This section expands the exam objective into a security investigation:

1. **Define the asset and boundary.** Write down what is being protected, who can reach it, and whether the control is enforced by the API server, admission, a node, the runtime, the network plugin, or the workload.
2. **Capture a baseline.** Record the current object, labels, identities, processes, ports, events, logs, and relevant configuration before making a change.
3. **Trace the control path.** Follow the request or workload through every intermediary. Do not stop at an object existing; verify that the active component consumes it.
4. **Make one narrow change.** Preserve unrelated workloads, names, namespaces, availability, and existing policy intent.
5. **Test both sides.** Prove the desired behavior and test a nearby denied, invalid, or unexpected case where applicable.
6. **Preserve evidence.** Save the command output, manifest, timestamp, and final status so another operator can reproduce the conclusion.

**Security focus:** Track provenance from source to digest, registry, admission or policy decision, and the running workload. A tag alone is weak evidence.

Suggested investigation commands:

~~~bash
kubectl get --raw='/readyz?verbose'
kubectl get nodes -o wide
kubectl get events -A --sort-by=.lastTimestamp
kubectl get pods -A -o wide
kubectl get RESOURCE NAME -n NAMESPACE -o yaml
kubectl describe RESOURCE NAME -n NAMESPACE
~~~

Replace the placeholders only after identifying the real resource. The describe command explains symptoms; rendered YAML and status prove the stored state.
