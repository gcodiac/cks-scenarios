# Perform static analysis of Kubernetes manifests — Production tutorial

Run analysis in CI and enforce organization rules at admission. AWS deployment tooling does not remove the need to inspect Kubernetes YAML.

A production implementation normally includes:

- an approved baseline and owner;
- infrastructure-as-code or image automation;
- monitoring and evidence retention;
- a change window, rollback, and exception expiry;
- a test after Kubernetes, node, image, or cloud changes.

On AWS, the same security intent applies. AWS may operate one layer, such as the EKS control plane, while your team owns identities, workload policy, node configuration, and evidence. Map that shared-responsibility boundary explicitly.
