# Finish – Falco Runtime Security Foundations

You have completed Scenario 1.

---

## What You Accomplished

In this lab, you:

- Deployed Falco into a kubeadm-based Kubernetes cluster using Helm
- Observed Falco running as a DaemonSet
- Triggered runtime detections from inside a container
- Inspected live Falco alerts
- Understood how Falco rules are managed in Kubernetes
- Learned how exam-style environments focus on inspection and modification rather than installation

---

## Continue Your Learning Path

This was the foundational scenario.

To build deeper runtime security skills, continue with:

### 📘 scenario-2-falco-rule-engineering

Focus on:

- Modifying rule priorities
- Creating custom Falco rules
- Reducing alert noise
- Validating rule behavior changes

This scenario simulates hands-on detection tuning.

---

### 🚨 scenario-3-falco-incident-response

Focus on:

- Investigating suspicious container behavior
- Interpreting Falco alerts in context
- Identifying attacker techniques
- Responding to runtime security events

This scenario simulates operational security workflows.
